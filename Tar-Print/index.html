            <p class="explain">Tar Print offers two methods of location specification – using location services or dropping a pin. If your location services are enabled for Tar Print, you will automatically be zoomed into your current locaction when you use the app. If you are at a stream testing location while using Tar Print, this is an extremely fast way of getting the data you need. Tar Print also generates the current coordinates for your documentation.</p>
            <p class="explain">You can alo use pins to mark a location on the map. Either type in the coordinate of your desired location, or click the pin button to drop a pin on the center of your screen.</p>
            <p class="explain">After you have a location, click on the gear button to change settings. Here you will be able to change the side length of your snapshot capture in miles, and you can specify if you would like to analyze the surfaces around either your current location or your pin.</p>
